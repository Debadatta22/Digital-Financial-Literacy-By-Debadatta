This is an internship project I completed under the Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM. I worked on Problem Statement No. 7: AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy.

I built the project on the IBM Cloud platform, using watsonx.ai as the primary studio to develop and configure the AI agent. The agent is powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses IBM Granite to provide reliable, multilingual financial guidance on topics like UPI usage, online scams, and personal budgeting.

## Problem Statement No.7 – AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy

The Challenge – An AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy, powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), helps users understand and navigate essential financial tools and practices. It retrieves reliable content on using UPI, avoiding online scams, understanding interest rates, budgeting, and personal finance management from government portals, banking websites, and educational platforms. With multilingual support, users from diverse backgrounds can interact in their preferred language and ask questions like “How do I send money via UPI?” or “What is a safe interest rate for a loan?” The agent ensures financial literacy is accessible, personalized, and culturally inclusive. This AI-driven assistant empowers users with knowledge, protects them from fraud, and builds confidence in digital finance.
Technology – Use of IBM Cloud Lite services / IBM Granite is mandatory.

## Description 

This project develops an AI agent for digital financial literacy, utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accessible and reliable financial guidance. The agent, built with IBM Cloud Lite services and powered by IBM Granite, helps users understand and navigate essential financial concepts such as UPI usage, online scam prevention, interest rates, and personal budgeting. By retrieving information from trusted sources like government portals and banking websites, and offering multilingual support, the agent ensures that financial knowledge is personalized, culturally inclusive, and readily available to a diverse user base. Ultimately, the goal is to empower individuals with the confidence and tools necessary to manage their finances securely and effectively in the digital age.

## IBM Cloud Overview

IBM Cloud is a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services offered by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) that provides infrastructure, platform, and software as a service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). It supports a broad range of applications, including AI, machine learning, data analytics, DevOps, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud-native development. IBM Cloud is designed to cater to enterprises and developers looking to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently across public, private, or hybrid cloud environments. It integrates modern technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud Foundry, and serverless computing, along with enterprise-grade capabilities like high availability, security, compliance, and governance.

A unique value proposition of IBM Cloud is its emphasis on open-source frameworks, AI-driven services (e.g., watsonx.ai), and enterprise-level data protection, especially for regulated industries. IBM Cloud provides a robust developer experience through a web-based console, CLI, SDKs, APIs, and automation tools. It offers flexible pricing plans, including a Lite plan with free-tier access, and is available across multiple global data centers for geographic scalability and data residency compliance.

The auto-coding chatbot and AI agent capabilities of IBM watsonx.ai were instrumental in this project. They allowed me to build the digital financial literacy agent without extensive manual coding.

The AI agent builder provided a streamlined interface to define the agent's persona and core functions, such as its greeting, behavior, and how it handles user queries. This enabled me to focus on the logical flow and the agent's personality rather than writing complex code from scratch.

Furthermore, the watsonx.ai platform facilitated the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which is crucial for this project's success. It allowed me to connect the agent to reliable external data sources—like government portals and banking websites—ensuring the information it provides is accurate and up-to-date. This automates the process of information retrieval and content generation, which would have been a significant coding challenge otherwise.

In short, watsonx.ai's tools enabled me to rapidly prototype, build, and deploy a sophisticated AI agent, shifting my focus from coding to the strategic design of a helpful and knowledgeable financial literacy assistant.
