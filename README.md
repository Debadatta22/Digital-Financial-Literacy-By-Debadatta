This is an internship project I completed under the Edunet Foundation in collaboration with IBM. I worked on Problem Statement No. 7: AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy.

I built the project on the IBM Cloud platform, using watsonx.ai as the primary studio to develop and configure the AI agent. The agent is powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and uses IBM Granite to provide reliable, multilingual financial guidance on topics like UPI usage, online scams, and personal budgeting.

## Problem Statement No.7 – AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy

The Challenge – An AI Agent for Digital Financial Literacy, powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), helps users understand and navigate essential financial tools and practices. It retrieves reliable content on using UPI, avoiding online scams, understanding interest rates, budgeting, and personal finance management from government portals, banking websites, and educational platforms. With multilingual support, users from diverse backgrounds can interact in their preferred language and ask questions like “How do I send money via UPI?” or “What is a safe interest rate for a loan?” The agent ensures financial literacy is accessible, personalized, and culturally inclusive. This AI-driven assistant empowers users with knowledge, protects them from fraud, and builds confidence in digital finance.
Technology – Use of IBM Cloud Lite services / IBM Granite is mandatory.
